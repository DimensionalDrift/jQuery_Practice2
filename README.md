# jQuery Practice 2

Apply the following behavior to the blue button in the button.html file:

- Create a CSS class (makeRed, add it to style.css) which gives the Button a red color, apply this class to the button Element (add to class attribute in the html).
- Create another class (makeBorder, add it to style.css) which gives the Button a border of 2px, do not apply to the HTML.
- On mouseenter remove the red class and add the border class.
- On mouseleave reverse the above.
- Use method chaining to achieve the above.
